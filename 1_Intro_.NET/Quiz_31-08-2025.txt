.NET Introduction 

QUIZ 

1 - 1
What is .Net
2 Marks
Programming Language
Scripting Language
x Framework
None of the above

2 - 2
What are the operations performed by CLR
2 Marks
Memory Management
Security Checks
Thread Management
x All of the above


3 - 3
In which forms assemblies are implemented
2 Marks
.exe
.dll
x Both
None



4 - Public assembly is also called as ?
2 Marks
Private Assembly
Shared Assembly
System Assembly
Multiple Assembly

Shared Assembly ✅

A Public Assembly is one that has a strong name and can be shared among multiple applications. Hence, it’s called a Shared Assembly.

👉 So the option Shared Assembly is correct.


5 - 5
Which code is directly executed by CLR
2 Marks
x Managed code
Unmanaged code
Compiled code
Native code

The correct answer is:

Managed code ✅

Managed code is the code that runs under the supervision of the CLR (Common Language Runtime).

It benefits from CLR services like memory management, security, and exception handling.

Unmanaged code (like C/C++ native code) runs outside CLR.

👉 So the option Managed code is correct.

6 - 6
Which applications are developed by .Net Framework
2 Marks
Console Applications
Windows Application
Web Applications
All of the above

7- 7
What is the extension of the project
2 Marks
x .cs project
.sln
.exe
.dll

.csproj ✅

In .NET, a project file has the extension .csproj (for C# projects).

.sln → Solution file (groups multiple projects).

.exe / .dll → Output files generated after compilation, not project files.

👉 So the correct extension of a project is .csproj.

🔹 Difference between .sln and .csproj

.sln (Solution File)

Stands for Solution.

It acts like a container that can hold one or more projects.

Useful when you have multiple projects that need to work together (e.g., Web API + Class Library + Console Test App).

Opened in Visual Studio to load the whole solution.

.csproj (C# Project File)

Stands for C# Project.

Each individual project (e.g., Console app, Class library, Web app) has its own .csproj.

Contains build configuration, references (NuGet packages, DLLs), target framework, etc.

When compiled, it produces an output assembly → .exe (for executables) or .dll (for libraries).


8 - 8
A solution is  a collection of
2 Marks
classes
x projects
programs
metadata

Projects ✅

A solution (.sln) in .NET is a collection of projects (.csproj, .vbproj, etc.).

Each project may contain classes, forms, resources, and references.

Multiple projects can be grouped into a single solution (e.g., a Web App + Class Library + Test Project).

👉 So the option projects is correct.


9 - 9
Why Garbage Collector is used
2 Marks
x Frees the used memory
Frees the empty memory
Frees the unused code
All of the above

rees the used memory ✅

The Garbage Collector (GC) in .NET is responsible for:

Automatically freeing memory occupied by objects that are no longer used/referenced.

Preventing memory leaks by reclaiming space and making it available for new objects.

🔹 It does not free "empty memory" (that’s already free) and it does not remove code.

10 - Which is used to download the required libraries
2 Marks
x NuGet packet Manager
Solution explorer
IDE
Visual Studio


NuGet Package Manager ✅

NuGet Package Manager is the tool in .NET used to download, install, update, and manage external libraries and dependencies.

Solution Explorer → used to view/manage files and projects in a solution.

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) → the environment itself (like Visual Studio).

Visual Studio → the IDE, but the actual library management is done via NuGet inside it.
