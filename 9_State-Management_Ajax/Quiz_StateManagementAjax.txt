State Management, Ajax 

QUIZ 


1
What are different types of state management techniques
2 Marks
Client-side
server-side
x Both A & B
None of the above


Both A & B

Explanation:
State management in ASP.NET has two categories:

Client-side techniques
ViewState
Hidden Fields
Cookies
Query Strings
Control State

Server-side techniques
Session
Application
Cache
Profile

Therefore, state management includes both client-side and server-side approaches.

2
What are client side state management techniques?
2 Marks
Viewstate
Querystring
Cookie
x All of the above


3
What are different types of cookies?
2 Marks
persistent cookies
Impersistent cookies
Non-persistent cookies
Both A & C

Both A & C
Explanation:
There are two main types of cookies:

Persistent Cookies
Stored on the client’s machine
Have an expiration date

Non-persistent Cookies (Session Cookies)
Exist only during the browser session
Deleted when the browser is closed
So Persistent Cookies (A) and Non-persistent Cookies (C) are the correct types.

✔ “Impersistent cookies” is not a valid term.



4
What are server side state management techniques?
2 Marks
Application
Cache
Querystring
Pagelevel cache


Explanation:
Server-side state management techniques include:
Session State
Application State
Cache
Profile

Why the others are wrong:
QueryString → Client-side
Page-level cache → This is part of output caching, but the option given does not match a standard server-side technique name.

So the correct choice from the options is:
Application  & Cache



5 Which ASP.NET object encapsulates the state of client and browser
2 Marks
application object
session object
response object
x request object

Request object

Explanation:
The Request object in ASP.NET encapsulates:
Information about the client (browser type, capabilities, IP address)
Data sent by the browser (headers, cookies, query string, form values)
Therefore, it represents the state of the client and the browser.

Why others are incorrect:
Application object → stores global data for all users
Session object → stores data per individual user
Response object → sends data back to the browser

✔ Correct: Request object



6
What are different types of cache?
2 Marks
Output cache
Data Cache
Fragment cache
x All of the above


All of the above

Explanation:
ASP.NET supports three main types of caching:
Output Cache: Caches entire page output.
Data Cache (Application Cache): Stores data objects (e.g., datasets, objects) in memory.
Fragment Cache: Caches parts of a page (user controls or specific sections).

✔ Therefore, all options are correct.



7
Where is cookie stored?
2 Marks
x Client machine
Server side
Both A & B
None


Client machine

Explanation:
A cookie is always stored on the client-side, typically inside the browser.
The server only sends cookies, but does not store them.

So the correct choice is:

✔ Client machine




8
Which of the following is not the way to maintain state
2 Marks
viewstate
Cookies
Hidden field
x Request object

Request object

Explanation:

The following ARE state-management techniques (client-side):
ViewState
Cookies
Hidden Field
But the Request object: Does not store state

Simply represents the current HTTP request sent by the browser
Contains query strings, form data, headers, etc.
Is not used to preserve data across postbacks

✔ Therefore, Request object is NOT a way to maintain state.


9
Point out Ajax Extensions
2 Marks
Script Manager
Update Panel
Both A & B
Ajax label

Both A & B

Explanation:
AJAX Extensions in ASP.NET include:
ScriptManager
Manages AJAX scripts and is required for using AJAX controls.
UpdatePanel
Enables partial postback (updates part of the page without refreshing the whole page).
"Ajax label" is not an actual AJAX extension control.

✔ So the right choice is Both A & B



10
Use of Ajax
2 Marks
Single browser compatabilty
x Reduce full-page refreshes
Allows page flicker
All of the above

Reduce full-page refreshes

Explanation:
AJAX is mainly used to:
Reduce full-page postbacks
Update portions of a page asynchronously
Make web applications faster and more responsive

Why the other options are incorrect:
Single browser compatibility: AJAX works across all major browsers, not just one.
Allows page flicker: AJAX prevents flicker by avoiding full-page reloads.

So the correct choice is: Reduce full-page refreshes
