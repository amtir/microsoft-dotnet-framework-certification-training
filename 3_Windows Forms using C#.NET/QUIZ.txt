1 - 1
Exceptional Handling handles which errors
2 Marks
Run time errors
Compile time rrors
Both A and B
Environment errors
Run time errors

Explanation:

In .NET, Exception Handling is specifically designed to handle runtime errors — situations that occur when the program is running, such as:

Division by zero

File not found

Null reference

Out-of-range array access

These errors cannot always be predicted or checked at compile time.

Compile-time errors (like syntax mistakes, missing semicolons, type mismatches) are detected by the compiler before the program runs, so they are not handled by Exception Handling.

Environment errors (like hardware failure, power outage) are outside the scope of .NET's Exception Handling.

✅ So the correct option is A. Run time errors.

Which methods are protecting the members of class
2 Marks
Get
Set
Both A and B
None of the above

Both A and B ✅

Explanation:

In C#, properties are used to protect and control access to class members (usually private fields).

The get method is used to read the value of a private member.

The set method is used to assign a value, with the option to add validation or restrictions.

Together, get and set methods encapsulate the fields and protect the members of the class from direct and unsafe access.

Example:
class Student
{
    private int age;

    public int Age
    {
        get { return age; }         // Protects by allowing controlled read
        set 
        { 
            if (value > 0)          // Validation before setting
                age = value; 
        }
    }
}


Here, both get and set protect the private field age.

👉 So the correct option is Both A and B.


4 - 4
Radio button is a ?
2 Marks
Multicontrol unit
Multineutral unit
Both A and B
x Single control unit

Single control unit ✅

Explanation:

A Radio Button in Windows Forms / ASP.NET / GUI programming allows the user to select only one option from a group of choices.

If you place multiple radio buttons in the same group (or container like a GroupBox), only one can be selected at a time.

This makes it a single control unit, unlike checkboxes which allow multiple selections.

👉 Correct option: Single control unit.

5 - 5
Which control helps to display datatable as output
2 Marks
ListBox
x Gridview
ComboBox
DataBox

GridView ✅

Explanation:

In .NET (especially ASP.NET and Windows Forms), the GridView control is used to display data in a tabular format (rows and columns).

It can be easily bound to a DataTable, DataSet, or database to show structured data.

Other options:

ListBox → Displays a simple list of items (single column).

ComboBox → Displays a dropdown list.

DataBox → ❌ Not an actual .NET control.

👉 So, the right answer is GridView.

6 - 6
Which control helps to display one item from list of items
2 Marks
ListBox
x ComboBox
DialogBox
PictureBox

ComboBox ✅

Explanation:

A ComboBox control in C# / .NET is used to display a list of items, but allows the user to select only one item at a time.

It combines the features of a TextBox (can show one value) and a ListBox (contains multiple items).

Other options:

ListBox → Displays multiple items, and user can select one or more (depending on SelectionMode).

DialogBox → Used for user interaction (e.g., Open File dialog), not for list selection.

PictureBox → Used to display images, not list items.

👉 Correct choice: ComboBox.

7 - 7
select correct Syntax for messagebox
2 Marks
x MessageBox.show("Hello");
MessageBox.display("Hello");
MessageBox.Look("hello");
None of the above

MessageBox.Show("Hello");

8 - 8
What are Events
2 Marks
Program actions
Application actions
x User actions
Empty actions


User actions ✅

Explanation:

In C# / .NET, events are mechanisms that let a class or object notify other classes or objects when something of interest happens.

These “happenings” are typically user actions such as:

Clicking a button

Typing in a textbox

Selecting an item from a list

Moving the mouse

Events are based on the publisher-subscriber model:

The publisher raises the event.

The subscribers handle the event with event handlers (delegate methods).

👉 So, the correct answer is User actions.


9 - What is Delegate
2 Marks
x 
Type safe function pointer
Instance pointer
A pointer to class
type unsafe function pointer


Type safe function pointer ✅

Explanation:

In C#, a delegate is a type-safe function pointer.

It can reference a method with a specific signature (return type + parameters).

Being type-safe means the compiler checks that the delegate’s signature matches the method it points to.

Delegates are commonly used in events and callbacks.



// Delegate declaration
public delegate void MyDelegate(string message);

// Method to point to
public void ShowMessage(string msg)
{
    Console.WriteLine(msg);
}

// Usage
MyDelegate del = ShowMessage;
del("Hello from delegate!");

👉 So, unlike C/C++ function pointers (which are unsafe), delegates in C# are type safe.




10 - Indexers are created using which keyword
2 Marks
Index
static
final
this

this ✅

Explanation:

In C#, an indexer allows objects of a class to be accessed like arrays using the [] operator.

Indexers are created using the this keyword along with parameters.

Syntax example:
class Sample
{
    private string[] data = new string[5];

    // Indexer using 'this'
    public string this[int index]
    {
        get { return data[index]; }
        set { data[index] = value; }
    }
}

Usage: 
Sample obj = new Sample();
obj[0] = "Hello";         // calls set
Console.WriteLine(obj[0]); // calls get


Other options:

Index ❌ → Not a valid keyword.

static ❌ → Used for static members.

final ❌ → C# doesn’t use final (Java does).

👉 Correct answer: this.
