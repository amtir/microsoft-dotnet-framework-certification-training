What is the full form of LINQ
2 Marks
x Language integrated query
Linked interface query
Language identifier query
none of the above

2 - Assume 2 columns named as Product and Category how can be both sorted out based on first by category and then by product name?
2 Marks
var sortedProds = _db.Products.Orderby(c => c.Category)
x var sortedProds = _db.Products.Orderby(c => c.Category) + ThenBy(n => n.Name)
var sortedProds = _db.Products.Orderby(c => c.Name) . ThenBy(n => n.Category)
all of the above



3 - 3
Choose the namespace in which the interface IEnumerable is declared?
2 Marks
System.Collections
System.Collections.Generic
x Both a & b
none of the above

Both a & b
Explanation:
IEnumerable exists in two namespaces:
System.Collections → IEnumerable (non-generic)
System.Collections.Generic → IEnumerable<T> (generic)
Therefore:
Correct: Both a & b

a a l h a b g m m a p e t a
x    a a a a a b e g h l m m p t
a g h l m m p t a a a a b e
runtime error

Let's list ALL characters from the strings:

Strings:

alpha → a, l, p, h, a

beta → b, e, t, a

gamma → g, a, m, m, a

Combine them:
a l p h a b e t a g a m m a

Sort alphabetically:
a a a a a b e g h l m m p t

Correct Answer:
a a a a a b e g h l m m p t


5 - 5
What will be the output of the given code snippet?
class Program
{
     static void Main(string[] args)
     {
         int[] nums = { 1, -2, 3, 0, -4, 5 };
         var posNums = nums.Where(n => n > 0).Select(r => r*2).OrderByDescending(r=>r);
         Console.Write("The positive values in nums: ");
         foreach(int i in posNums)

code run successfully prints nothing
run time error
x code run successfully prints multiple of 2
compile time error
Output:
The positive values in nums: 10 6 2
The code is valid, runs successfully, and prints multiples of 2 of the positive numbers.
Correct Answer:
code run successfully prints multiple of 2


6 - 6
What will be the output of the given code snippet?
class Program
{
     static void Main(string[] args)
     {
         int[] nums = {3, 1, 2, 5, 4};
         var ltAvg = from n in nums
                     let x = nums.Average()
                     where n < x
                     select n;
         Console.WriteLine("The average is " + nums.Average());
         Console.ReadLine();
     }
}
2 Marks
Run time error
x 3
5
Compile time error

Compute the average:
(3 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 4) = 15
15 / 5 = 3
The program does not print ltAvg
It only prints:
The average is 3
There is no runtime error and no compile error.
Correct Answer: 3


7 - What will be the output of the given code snippet?
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Expression<Func<int, int, bool>>
        IsFactorExp = (n, d) => (d != 0) ? (n % d) == 0 : false;
        Func<int, int, bool> IsFactor = IsFactorExp.Compile();
        if (IsFactor(10, 5))
        Console.WriteLine("5 is a factor of 10.");
        if (!IsFactor(343, 7))
        Console.WriteLine("7 is not a factor of 10.");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
2 Marks
Compile time error
Run time error
5 is a factor of 10
7 is not a factor of 10
x 5 is a factor of 10



8 - 8

        int[] nums = { 1, -2, 3, 0, -4, 5 };
        int len = /*_________________ */
        Console.WriteLine("The number of positive values in nums: " + len);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
2 Marks
from n in nums where n > 0
select n
from n in nums where n > 0

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] nums = { 1, -2, 3, 0, -4, 5 };
        var posNums = from n in nums
                      where n > 0
                      select n;
        int len = posNums.Count();
        Console.WriteLine(len);
        Console.ReadLine();

Three-tier architecture includes which of the following?
2 Marks
Three server layers
A client layer and two server layers
Two client layers and one server layer
Three client layers



11 - 11
3-tier architectures cannot be properly tested because network load is highly variable.
2 Marks
TRUE
x FALSE

Explanation
3-tier architectures can be properly tested, including:
Unit testing
Integration testing
Load testing
Stress testing
End-to-end testing
Network load variability does not prevent proper testing — it simply requires using tools like:
JMeter
LoadRunner
k6
Visual Studio Load Tests
So the statement is incorrect.


12 - Which of the following are the benefits of using 3-tier architecture?
2 Marks
New modules can be built to support specific business needs
Performance improves for compiled SQL statements
Results in a thinner client and database server
x All of the above

All of the above
Explanation
3-tier architecture offers several benefits:
New modules can be built easily
Because business logic is separated, new features can be added without affecting UI or database layers.
Performance improves for compiled SQL
The Data Access Layer can optimize queries, caching, connection pooling, etc.
Thinner client and database server
The Business Logic Layer (“middle tier”) does the heavy work, reducing load on UI and DB.


13 - 13
Client/server architecture includes which of the following securities?
2 Marks
Physical security
Change control security
Measures taken to secure all systems
All of the above

All of the above
Explanation
Client/server architecture must consider multiple layers of security:
Physical security
Protect hardware, servers, network equipment.
Change control security
Ensure software updates, patches, and configuration changes are controlled.
System-wide security measures
Firewall, authentication, encryption, antivirus, network policies, etc.


14 - Database server is responsible for?
2 Marks
x Database storage
Data processing logic
Data presentation logic
All of the above


15 - 15
Applications / assemblies talk with each other by using which of the data formats?
2 Marks
SQL queries
CSV files
XML files
x All of the above

Applications and assemblies can communicate using many kinds of data formats, including:
SQL queries (database-level communication)
CSV files (simple data exchange)
XML files (structured data communication, configuration, web services)
All are valid forms of interoperability depending on the system design.
