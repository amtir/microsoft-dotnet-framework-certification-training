WEB SERVER CONTROLS
QUIZ 

1 - Where are Html controls processed?
2 Marks
Server side
x Client side
Both  A & B
Inside application

client side
Explanation:
HTML controls (like <input>, <button>, <select>, etc.) are standard HTML elements that run entirely in the client’s browser — they are not processed by the server unless they are explicitly converted to server controls (by adding runat="server").

So:
HTML controls → Client side
ASP.NET Server controls (<asp:Button>, <asp:TextBox>) → Server side

2 Where are Web server  controls processed?
2 Marks
x Server side
Client side
Inside application
Both  A & B

Server side
Explanation:
Web Server Controls (such as <asp:Button>, <asp:TextBox>, <asp:GridView>, etc.) are processed on the server side.
They are rendered as standard HTML for the client browser.
Their events (like Click, TextChanged, etc.) are handled on the server during the ASP.NET page lifecycle.
In short:
HTML controls → Client side
Web server controls → Server side

3 - 3
To display a list of clients &  to edit the clients on a webpage.Which webcontrol is best suited in this scenario
2 Marks
Table control
x Gridview
Formview control
Detailsview

The GridView control in ASP.NET is ideal when you need to:
Display a list of records (like clients) in a tabular format, and
Provide editing, deleting, and updating functionality directly in the same grid.
Summary:
Control	Purpose
Table	Static layout only — no data binding or edit support
GridView	Best for displaying & editing multiple records
FormView	Displays one record at a time, customizable layout
DetailsView	Displays one record at a time in a table format
Hence, GridView is the most suitable control for listing and editing clients.

4 - 4
From performance point of view which is faster
2 Marks
Datalist
Datagrid
x Repeater
Dataview

Repeater
Explanation:
From a performance point of view, the Repeater control is the fastest among data-bound controls because:
It has no built-in layout or extra features (like paging, sorting, or selection).
It simply renders the data using templates — minimal overhead.
Performance ranking (fast → slower):
Repeater → DataList → DataGrid → GridView
Repeater is the correct answer.

5 - 5
Where is the viewstate information stored?
2 Marks
In the form
In TAG field
In html Runat field
x In the HTML hidden field

In the HTML hidden field
Explanation:
In ASP.NET, ViewState stores the state of page and control values between postbacks.
It’s serialized and encoded into a hidden field named __VIEWSTATE within the HTML form.
When the page is submitted, this hidden field’s data is sent back to the server to restore control states.
Summary:
Stored in: <input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" ... />
Purpose: Preserve page and control values between requests
Location: HTML hidden field inside the form

6 - 6
Which control helps to display all rows of datatable
2 Marks
ColumnView
x Gridview
Detailsview
All of the above

GridView
Explanation:
The GridView control is designed to display all rows from a DataTable (or any tabular data source) in a structured, tabular format.
GridView → Displays multiple rows and columns (ideal for full table display).
DetailsView → Displays one record at a time.
ColumnView →  Not an ASP.NET control (it’s used in other frameworks like DevExpress).
Therefore, the correct answer is GridView.


7 - 7
Properties of Literal?
2 Marks
Color
size
Font
x None of the above

None of the above
Explanation:
The Literal control in ASP.NET is a very lightweight control used to display static text or HTML on a page.
It does not support style-related properties like Color, Size, or Font.
It only has simple properties such as:
Text → the content to display
Mode → how the text is rendered (Encode, PassThrough, or Transform)
Therefore, None of the above is correct.

8 - 8
Which control helps to display single row of datatable
2 Marks
ColumnView
Gridview
x Detailsview
All of the above

DetailsView
Explanation:
The DetailsView control in ASP.NET is specifically designed to display a single row (or record) from a DataTable or data source at a time.
It shows each field in a separate row (like a form), and it can also support editing, inserting, and deleting that one record.
Summary:
Control	Displays
GridView	Multiple rows (tabular view)
DetailsView	 Single row (record)
ColumnView	 Not a standard ASP.NET control
Hence, the correct answer is DetailsView.


9 - 9
Choose List controls
2 Marks
DropDownList
ListBox
CheckBoxList
x All of the above

All of the above
Explanation:
In ASP.NET, all these are List controls — they display lists of items and allow users to make selections.
Control	Description
DropDownList	Displays items in a dropdown menu (single selection).
ListBox	Displays a scrollable list of items (single or multiple selection).
CheckBoxList	Displays a list of checkboxes (multiple selections).


10 - 10
Advantages of Data Binding
2 Marks
can refer to the database without writing code
data manipulation
can refer to the database with writing code
x Both A & B

Both A & B
Explanation:
Data Binding in ASP.NET provides several advantages:
(A) You can connect UI controls (like GridView, DropDownList, etc.) to a database or data source with minimal or no code.
(B) You can also perform data manipulation — such as display, update, insert, and delete — easily using data-bound controls.
Therefore, the correct answer is Both A & B.
