ADO.NET  Daa Access from SQL 


QUIZ

1 - 1
In a connection string _____________ represents name of the database
2 Marks
Data Source
x Initial Catalog
catalog initial
Database

In an ADO.NET SQL Server connection string:
👉 Initial Catalog (or synonym Database) specifies the name of the database.
Example:
Data Source=LAPTOP-85MTF1DV;Initial Catalog=EmployeeDB;Integrated Security=True;
Data Source → the server / instance
Initial Catalog=EmployeeDB → the database name

2  - 2
ADO .NET is a?
2 Marks
Framework
Class
Namespace
x API

👉 ADO.NET is a Namespace in the .NET Framework (System.Data, System.Data.SqlClient, etc.) that provides classes for data access.

✅ Correct answer: Namespace


3 - 3
What are the Command Object Methods?
2 Marks
ExecuteNonQuery
ExecuteReader
ExecuteScalar
x All of the above.

👉 The Command object in ADO.NET supports several execution methods:
ExecuteNonQuery() → for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (returns affected rows)
ExecuteReader() → for SELECT (returns a DataReader)
ExecuteScalar() → for single values (first column of first row)
✅ Correct answer: All of the above

4 - 4
When you create a relationship between tables in ADO.NET DataSet
2 Marks
A UniqueConstraint is added to the parent table
A ForeignKeyConstraint is added to the child table by default
Both a and b
None

When you create a relationship (DataRelation) between tables in an ADO.NET DataSet:
A UniqueConstraint is added automatically to the parent table.
A ForeignKeyConstraint is added automatically to the child table.
👉 So both are true.
✅ Correct answer: Both a and b

5 -5
Which of the following is not a DataReader method?
2 Marks
NextResult
GetName
GetValue
GetDataType

Let’s check the DataReader methods in ADO.NET:
✅ NextResult() → moves to the next result set.
✅ GetName(int i) → gets column name.
✅ GetValue(int i) → gets value of column.
❌ GetDataType → does not exist (the actual method is GetDataTypeName(int i) or GetFieldType(int i)).
👉 Therefore:
✅ Correct answer: GetDataType

6 -  6
Which database is the ADO.NET SqlConnection object designed for?
2 Marks
x MSSQL Server
Oracle Db
MySQL
Hadoop Database

👉 The SqlConnection object in ADO.NET is specifically designed for Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL Server).
✅ Correct answer: MSSQL Server



7 - 7
Which is not an ADO.NET DataAdapter Object?
2 Marks
OleDbDataAdapter
SQLDataAdapter
x QueryDataAdapter
All of the above.

In ADO.NET, valid DataAdapter objects include:
OleDbDataAdapter → for OLE DB data sources
SqlDataAdapter → for SQL Server
OdbcDataAdapter → for ODBC
👉 There is no such thing as SQLDataAdapter (it should be SqlDataAdapter, note the casing) and definitely no QueryDataAdapter.
So the one that is not an ADO.NET DataAdapter object is:
✅ Correct answer: QueryDataAdapter

8 - 8
Which of the following illustrates the benefit of ADO.NET?
2 Marks
Interoperability
It uses DataSet to represent data in memory that can store data from multiple tables and multiple sources.
Disconnected data access
x All of the above.

ADO.NET provides:
Interoperability (works with different databases / providers)
DataSet (can hold multiple tables from multiple sources in memory)
Disconnected data access (work offline with DataSet, reconnect later)
👉 All are correct.
✅ Correct answer: All of the above


9 - 9
Which object does the data-aware control bind to?
2 Marks
x Dataset
DataAdapter
DataReader
Allof the above

In ADO.NET, data-aware controls (like DataGridView, ComboBox, etc.) bind to objects that implement IList, IListSource, or IBindingList.

✅ DataSet (or more specifically DataTable / DataView inside it) can be bound.
❌ DataAdapter is only for filling a DataSet; it’s not directly bindable.
❌ DataReader is forward-only, read-only; not suitable for direct binding.
👉 So the correct one is:
✅ Correct answer: Dataset


10 - 10
Which of the following method of the command object is best suited when you have aggregate functions in a SELECT statement?
2 Marks
x ExecuteScalar
ExecuteReader
x ExecuteNonQuery
None

When your SELECT query has aggregate functions (like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN), you only need a single value back.
👉 That’s exactly what ExecuteScalar() is for — it returns the first column of the first row from the result set.
✅ Correct answer: ExecuteScalar



11 - To perform Insert, Update and Delete Command which method is used?
2 Marks
ExecuteReader
x ExecuteNonQuery
ExecuteScalar
None

That’s a classic 💡
ExecuteReader() → returns rows (for SELECT)
ExecuteScalar() → returns a single value (like COUNT, SUM)
ExecuteNonQuery() → used for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (returns number of rows affected)
✅ Correct answer: ExecuteNonQuery


12 - 12
Which DataAdapter Query Type can be used with the Access database?
2 Marks
x Use SQL statements.
Create a new stored procedure.
Use existing stored procedure.
All of the above.

With Microsoft Access (via OleDbDataAdapter):

✅ You can use SQL statements (e.g., SELECT * FROM Employees).
❌ You cannot create stored procedures in Access.
❌ You cannot use existing stored procedures (Access doesn’t support them).
👉 So only plain SQL works.
✅ Correct answer: Use SQL statements.




13 - 13
The default timeout for SqlCommand.Command timeout property
2 Marks
10 Seconds
x 30 Seconds
60Seconds
40  Seconds

👉 The default value of SqlCommand.CommandTimeout is 30 seconds.
(After that, the command aborts if no response.)
✅ Correct answer: 30 Seconds



14 - 14
How do you execute multiple SQL statements using a DataReader?
2 Marks
Call the ExecuteReadermethod of two Command objects and assign the results tothe same instance of a DataReader.
Call the ExecuteReadermethod of a single Command object twice.
x Set the Command.CommandTextproperty to multiple SQL statements delimited by a semicolon.
Set the Command.CommandTypeproperty to multiple result sets.

In ADO.NET, you can send multiple SQL statements in a single CommandText, separated by semicolons, and then process them with a DataReader using .NextResult().
👉 So the correct choice is:
✅ Set the Command.CommandText property to multiple SQL statements delimited by a semicolon.


15 - What property contains the actual error message returned by SQL Server?
2 Marks
SqlError.Message
SqlException.Message
x Both a and b
none

SqlError.Message → each individual error returned from SQL Server has a Message property.
SqlException.Message → the exception object itself also exposes a Message (usually from the first SqlError).
👉 So both can contain the error text.
✅ Correct answer: Both a and b
