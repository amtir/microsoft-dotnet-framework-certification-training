QUIZ 


1 - 1
What is collection?
2 Marks
A biult in data structure
Stores huge amount of data
store data temporarily
x All of these

All of these ✅
👉 In C#, a collection is a built-in data structure that can store large amounts of data and temporarily hold objects in memory for processing.


2 - 2
Which is a root collection in .NET
2 Marks
x IEnumerable
ICollection
Iroot
IDictionary

IEnumerable ✅
👉 In .NET, IEnumerable is the root collection interface. All other collection interfaces (like ICollection, IList, IDictionary, etc.) inherit from it, because it provides the basic functionality to iterate over a collection.

3 - 3
Which are prioritised collections?
2 Marks
array & Arraylist
x Stack & Queue
Hashtable
Sortedlist

Stack & Queue ✅
👉 They are called prioritized collections because they store and retrieve elements based on order rules:
Stack → LIFO (Last In, First Out)
Queue → FIFO (First In, First Out)


4 - 4
Advantage of Arraylist
2 Marks
stores only one type of elements
Size is fixed
x stores different type of elements
None of these

stores different type of elements ✅
👉 ArrayList in C# can hold elements of different data types since it stores them as object.
Not restricted to a single type
Size is dynamic (not fixed like arrays)

5 - 5
What is the use of Generics?
2 Marks
Helps to store & handle any type of data
Handle huge data
x Helps to store and handle one type of data
Helps to declare objects

Helps to store and handle one type of data ✅
👉 Generics in C# allow you to create classes, methods, and collections that are type-safe and work with a specific data type without boxing/unboxing, improving performance and reducing errors.


6 - 6
What is an Assembly
2 Marks
Smallest unit of deployment in .NET
contains both .exe and .dll files
Logical Unit of .Net compilation
x ll  of these

The correct answer is:
All of these ✅
👉 An Assembly in .NET is:
The smallest unit of deployment (can be versioned and deployed independently).
Can be an .exe (application) or .dll (library).
Considered the logical unit of .NET compilation (contains IL code + metadata).

7 - When .exe file is generated?
2 Marks
For a class which contains main method
x For a class which has no main
when a class is compiled
For class, which contains public methods

For a class which contains main method ✅
👉 In C#, an .exe file is generated only when the program has an entry point, i.e., a Main() method. Otherwise, compilation produces a .dll file (library).

8 - 8
How many number of assemblies exists?
2 Marks
1
x 2
3
4

2 ✅
👉 In .NET, there are two types of assemblies:
Private Assembly – Used only by a single application.
Shared (Public) Assembly – Stored in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and can be used by multiple applications.


9 - 9
Public assembly Is also called as?
2 Marks
Private assembly
assembly
x shared  assembly
None of these

shared assembly ✅
👉 A public assembly is also known as a shared assembly, because it is stored in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and can be shared among multiple applications.



10 - 10
What is GAC?
2 Marks
Global Assembly Cache
Repository for all assemblies
contains libraries, accessible for other applications
x All of these

All of these ✅
👉 GAC (Global Assembly Cache) is:
A global repository for assemblies.
Stores shared assemblies (public assemblies).
Contains libraries that are accessible by multiple applications.
